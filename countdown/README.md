The countdown to the most awesome thing ever. DubHacks is the Pacific Northwest's flagship hackathon. Conceived of and organized by three different student groups at the University of Washington– IUGA, Startup UW, and Sudo Soliders– the inaugural DubHacks Hakcathon, being held this October, has been 7 months in the making.
